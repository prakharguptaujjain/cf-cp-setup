# CF & CP Setup

Please change the locations in the script accordingly

## My-setup

I use two tools `https://github.com/xalanq/cf-tool` and `Competitive Companion (both browser and vscode extension)`
During contest, I usually first run `starter.sh` and this create contest folder, then what i do is open vscode in base directory and use `cph_helper` extension to create questions, which are created in base dir, then after solving the question go to `cf/contest/{Contest number}/{Question number}` there you will see `submit.sh`, just run this file, and your code will be submitted

I also use some boiler_plate and the most important helper for me is ahk scripts for cpp, checkout [ahk](https://github.com/prakharguptaujjain/ahk)
